## Architecture

The microservice is designed to operate independently, making it ideal for **microservice-based systems** like Time:

1. **Input Layer**  
   Receives user posts, comments, and search queries for analysis.  

2. **Detection Layer**  
   NLP-based processing evaluates severity using keywords, context patterns, and behavioral indicators.  

3. **Intervention Layer**  
   Determines the appropriate intervention and generates UI elements (e.g., bottom sheets) for the app.  

4. **Logging & Analytics Layer**  
   Stores anonymized intervention data and metrics for reporting and continuous improvement.
