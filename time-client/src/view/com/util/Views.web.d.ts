/**
 * In the Web build, we center all content so that it mirrors the
 * mobile experience (a single narrow column). We then place a UI
 * shell around the content if you're in desktop.
 *
 * Because scrolling is handled by components deep in the hierarchy,
 * we can't just wrap the top-level element with a max width. The
 * centering has to be done at the ScrollView.
 *
 * These components wrap the RN ScrollView-based components to provide
 * consistent layout. It also provides <CenteredView> for views that
 * need to match layout but which aren't scrolled.
