/**
 * TipTap is a stateful rich-text editor, which is extremely useful
 * when you _want_ it to be stateful formatting such as bold and italics.
 *
 * However we also use "stateless" behaviors, specifically for URLs
 * where the text itself drives the formatting.
 *
 * This plugin uses a regex to detect URIs and then applies
 * link decorations (a <span> with the "autolink") class. That avoids
 * adding any stateful formatting to TipTap's document model.
 *
 * We then run the URI detection again when constructing the
 * RichText object from TipTap's output and merge their features into
 * the facet-set.
