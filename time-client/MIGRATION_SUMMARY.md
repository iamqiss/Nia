## 🔍 Final Verification Results

```
🔍 Final Migration Verification:
1. AT Protocol references: 0
2. REST fallback code: 0  
3. BskyAgent references: 0
4. gRPC client exists: ✅

🎉 MIGRATION COMPLETE - NO MORE ATPROTO!
```

## 🎯 Mission Status: COMPLETE

The Time Social client has been **completely migrated** from AT Protocol to gRPC. All AT Protocol dependencies have been purged, all REST fallback code has been removed, and the application now runs on a pure gRPC architecture.

**No more atproto!** 🚀
